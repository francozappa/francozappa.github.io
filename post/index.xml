      <title>HowTo: Connect to the SUTD&#39;s eduroam using (Arch) Linux</title>

      <description>After the post about connecting to SUTD&amp;rsquo;s VPN is now time to connect eduroam! Again, SUTD&amp;rsquo;s IT support for (Arch) Linux at the time of writing is none.
SUTD runs a setup with only username-password (no certificates required) and the connection can be established using the GUI of NetworkManager. If your WiFi card is on and eduroam is in your range you should see the eduroam SSID on the list of the available WiFi networks.</description>

      <title>HowTo: Connect to the SUTD&#39;s VPN using (Arch) Linux as a Student</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently came across the problem of connecting to the SUTD VPN server from overseas. SUTD&amp;rsquo;s IT support for (Arch) Linux at the time of writing is none, and after a bit of research I&amp;rsquo;ve found a quick and easy solution.
SUTD runs Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) server, a commercial solution known as Juniper SSL VPN. Luckily there is an open-source client that supports PCS named OpenConnect. Arch has an openconnect package and a NetworkManager plugin called networkmanager-openconnect.</description>

      <description>For some reasons my name_surname@sutd.edu.sg email address was deactivated without notice sometime at the end of October 2017. Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered it only this week and I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to reactivate it. I apologize if you recently got an error message while trying to send me an email to that address.

      <title>S317: MiniCPS Challenges</title>

      <description>I recently open-sourced the code that I developed for the MiniCPS challenges for the SWaT Security Showdown (S3) event in 2017.
Here is the code.
The init.sh contains the list of commands that I run on a local testing machine and on the remote AWS instances that we used during the event. The attackers were provided with the VPN credentials to access two different subnetworks in a mixed MiniCPS simulation eg: water treatment (SWaT) and water distribution (WaDI).</description>
