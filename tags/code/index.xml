      <description>The camera-ready version of Nearby Threats: Reversing‚ Analyzing‚ and Attacking Google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Nearby Connections&amp;rdquo; on Android is available here
We also released a proof of concept code to perform the Soft AP manipulation attack. The code was previously disclosed to Google. In summary, the attack allows a malicious Nearby Connections server (advertiser) to redirect a client to a malicious Internet connected access point. As a result the attacker can reconfigure the wireless network interface of the victim via DHCP and gets access to all the Wi-Fi traffic (even traffic from non Nearby Connections applications).</description>

      <description>I recently open-sourced the code that I developed for the MiniCPS challenges for the SWaT Security Showdown (S3) event in 2017.
Here is the code.
The init.sh contains the list of commands that I run on a local testing machine and on the remote AWS instances that we used during the event. The attackers were provided with the VPN credentials to access two different subnetworks in a mixed MiniCPS simulation eg: water treatment (SWaT) and water distribution (WaDI).</description>
