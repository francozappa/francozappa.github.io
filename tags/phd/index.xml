      <description>&lt;p&gt;Soon I&amp;rsquo;m going to defend my PhD thesis at SUTD. Feel free to join!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date and time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, 5 July 2019, 10:00 - 11:00 (AM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Venue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think Tank 20 (2.305)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title of the talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of Secure Cyber-Physical and Wireless System&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the presentation we will talk about our recent
contributions in the area of wireless systems security.
Wireless systems are used to transmit (sensitive) information and to manage
and monitor systems remotely. In our recent works we focus on three problems
to advance the security of wireless systems:
effectiveness of deployed physical layer features as defense mechanisms,
complexity and accessibility of wireless technologies, and security
evaluations of wireless protocols. Firstly, we present a theoretical and
empirical comparisons between b/n/ac amendments of IEEE 802.11 (WLAN).
Our goal is to estimate and measure whether or not modern physical layer
features, such as MIMO and beamforming, could be used to as defense mechanism.
Afterwards, we will talk about our security analysis of Nearby Connections, a
proprietary API for proximity-based services developed by Google. This API
uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and it is included in all Android
devices since version 4.0 and all Android Things devices. Our analysis
uncovers the proprietary (security) mechanisms of Nearby Connections and it is
based on our reverse-engineering of its implementation. We demonstrate that
Nearby Connections is vulnerable to critical threats by implementing  attacks
where we maliciously manipulate Nearby Connections and we extend the
connection range to devices that are not nearby. Prior to publication we
disclosed our findings to Google and we suggested them effective
countermeasures. In the last part of the presentation we will summarize our
contributions in the area of cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular we
will introduce MiniCPS, a toolkit for real-time CPS simulation and emulation
and its related projects and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
