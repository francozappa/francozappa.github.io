Being a pervasive technology, Bluetooth exposes a broad attack surface.

The security of Bluetooth communication heavily depends on the Bluetooth standard, which defines \u0026ldquo;standard-compliant\u0026rdquo; security mechanisms to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Bluetooth communications. Those mechanisms include pairing and secure session establishment protocols used to establish keys and protect the communication.\nThis talk revisits our recent work about uncovering, exploring, and fixing three critical vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth standard.

Bluetooth runs on billions of devices including mobile, wearables, home automation, smart speakers, headsets, industrial and medical appliances, and vehicles. As a result, Bluetooth's attack surface is huge and includes significant threats such as identity thefts, privacy violations, and malicious device control. Bluetooth is a complex technology specified in an open standard. The standard defines two wireless stacks Bluetooth Classic for high throughput services (e.g., audio and voice) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for very low power services (e.g., localization, and monitoring). The standard defines security mechanisms to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of Bluetooth communications. Those mechanisms include pairing to share a long term key among two devices, and secure session establishment to let two paired devices negotiate session keys to protect their communication. A single vulnerability in a standard-compliant security mechanism translates into billions of exploitable devices. This talk reviews several standard-compliant vulnerabilities that we recently uncovered on the key negotiation and authentication mechanisms of Bluetooth Classic and BLE. We also describe how to exploit such vulnerabilities to perform key negotiation attacks on Bluetooth Classic and BLE (KNOB attacks, CVE-2019-9506) and impersonation attacks on Bluetooth Classic (BIAS attacks, CVE-2020-10135). The attacks are presented together with a detailed description of the Bluetooth treat model and the affected security mechanism.  We also explain how we implemented such attacks using low-cost hardware and open-source software and how we evaluated them on actual devices from the major vendors including Apple, Broadcom, Cypress, CSR, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Qualcomm. Finally, we describe how the Bluetooth standard was amended after the disclosure of our attacks, our proposed countermeasures, and why most of the Bluetooth devices are still vulnerable to our attacks.","tags":null,"title":"BIAS and KNOB attacks against Bluetooth BR/EDR/LE","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"BIAS + KNOB attack against Bluetooth:\n  All the WAC talks are available on YouTube\n","date":1597190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597190400,"objectID":"cadbb084e6a08ee69e602d6e4032ea18","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/wac320-video/","publishdate":"2020-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/wac320-video/","section":"post","summary":"BIAS + KNOB attack against Bluetooth:\n  All the WAC talks are available on YouTube","tags":["wac","knob","bias","video"],"title":"WAC3 Presentation is Online","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary The Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP3T) is a system for secure and privacy-preserving proximity tracing at large scale. DP3T provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures to break its transmission chain.\nThe system aims to minimise privacy and security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact’s identity or where the contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user’s phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close proximity.\nWhen a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server.

The Workshop will be held online on Zoom the 16th of August 2020, and my talk will be from 13:20 to 14:00 (EDT) in the Attacks on Standards session (session IV).\nThis is the talk abstract:\n Bluetooth is a ubiquitous technology for low power wireless communications. Bluetooth runs on billions of devices including mobile, wearables, home automation, smart speakers, headsets, industrial and medical appliances, and vehicles. As a result, Bluetooth\u0026rsquo;s attack surface is huge and includes significant threats such as identity thefts, privacy violations, and malicious device control.\nBluetooth is a complex technology specified in an open standard. The standard defines two wireless stacks Bluetooth Classic for high throughput services (e.g., audio and voice) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for very low power services (e.g., localization, and monitoring). The standard defines security mechanisms to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of Bluetooth communications. Those mechanisms include pairing to share a long term key among two devices, and secure session establishment to let two paired devices negotiate session keys to protect their communication. A single vulnerability in a standard-compliant security mechanism translates into billions of exploitable devices.\nThis talk reviews several standard-compliant vulnerabilities that we recently uncovered on the key negotiation and authentication mechanisms of Bluetooth Classic and BLE. We also describe how to exploit such vulnerabilities to perform key negotiation attacks on Bluetooth Classic and BLE (KNOB attacks, CVE-2019-9506) and impersonation attacks on Bluetooth Classic (BIAS attacks, CVE-2020-10135). The attacks are presented together with a detailed description of the Bluetooth treat model and the affected security mechanism. We also explain how we implemented such attacks using low-cost hardware and open-source software and how we evaluated them on actual devices from the major vendors including Apple, Broadcom, Cypress, CSR, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Qualcomm. Finally, we describe how the Bluetooth standard was amended after the disclosure of our attacks, our proposed countermeasures, and why most of the Bluetooth devices are still vulnerable to our attacks.\n For more details about the KNOB and BIAS attacks have a look at the related research papers:\n The KNOB is Broken: Exploiting Low Entropy in the Encryption Key Negotiation of Bluetooth BR/EDR, USENIX Security 2019.

CPS are composed or sensors, actuators and controllers, and they are used to manage different processes such as industrial plants. Securing CPS is an open challenge and attacks such as Stuxnet and TRITON have reiterated the importance of securing CPS. In this work we focus on three (intertwined) problems to advance the security of CPS, namely technologies and processes, multi-disciplinary communities, and threat models and incentives. To address these problems we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of MiniCPS, an open-source toolkit for lightweight and real-time simulation of CPS. MiniCPS is built on top of Mininet, a network emulator based on Linux containers. We explore the usability of MiniCPS to develop defense mechanisms for CPS, with a particular emphasis on honeypots. A honeypot is a virtual or physical replica of a real system deployed to detect, mitigate and counteract cyber attacks. We leverage MiniCPS to design, implement and evaluate a novel high-interaction honeypot for industrial control systems. In addition, we test the effectiveness of MiniCPS as an educational and experimentation tool to help cybersecurity researchers and professionals. In particular, we used MiniCPS to design novel cybersecurity challenges based on real-time simulations of CPS. The challenges were proposed in a gamified security competition that we designed called SWaT Security Showdown (S3). The second part of the dissertation presents our contributions in the area of wireless systems security. Wireless systems are used to transmit (sensitive) information and to manage and monitor systems remotely. In this work we focus on three problems to advance the security of wireless systems, namely effectiveness of deployed physical layer features as defense mechanisms, complexity and accessibility of wireless technologies, and security evaluations of wireless protocols. Firstly, we present a comparison between b/n/ac amendments of IEEE 802.11 (WLAN) where we theoretically estimate and empirically measure that recent physical layer features, such as MIMO and beamforming, could be used to mitigate passive eavesdropping attacks. These features are already present in commercial devices and they are complementary to the other (upper-layer) security mechanisms. Then, we present the first security analysis of Nearby Connections, an API for proximity-based services developed by Google. The API uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and it is included in all Android devices since version 4.0 and all Android Things devices. Our analysis uncovers the proprietary (security) mechanisms of Nearby Connections and it is based on our reverse-engineering of its implementation. We demonstrate attacks where we maliciously manipulate Nearby Connections, and we extend the connection range to devices that are not nearby. Prior to publication we disclosed our findings to Google and we suggested them effective countermeasures. Finally, we describe how we found and exploited an architectural vulnerability of Bluetooth BR/EDR. We show how an attacker can downgrade the entropy any Bluetooth BR/EDR encryption key to 1 byte without being detected, and brute force the low entropy key in real time. We call our attack the Key Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack. We implement the attack and evaluate it on 21 Bluetooth vulnerable devices and we recommended to the Bluetooth SIG effective countermeasures.","tags":["phd thesis wireless cyber-physical"],"title":"Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of Secure Cyber-Physical and Wireless Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m glad to announce that I\u0026rsquo;ve completed my PhD in Computer Science at SUTD about Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of Secure Cyber-Physical and Wireless Systems.

The KNOB attack is listed as CVE-2019-9506.\nThe KNOB attack exploits the fact that the specification of Bluetooth includes an encryption key negotiation protocol that allows to negotiate encryption keys with entropy as low as 1 Byte, without protecting the integrity of the negotiation process. A remote attacker can manipulate the entropy negotiation to let any standard compliant Bluetooth device negotiate encryption keys with 1 byte of entropy, and then brute force the low entropy keys in real time.\nBelow my paper presentation at USENIX Security 2019:\n  KNOB Attack on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) The Key Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is presented in our paper titled Key Negotiation Downgrade Attacks on Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy.\n","date":1566259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566259200,"objectID":"842738d29027ad81ea0bbaf91c0a18a3","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/project/knob/","publishdate":"2019-08-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/knob/","section":"project","summary":"Standard-compliant attacks to the Key Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB)","tags":["protocol","bluetooth","knob"],"title":"KNOB Attacks","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this post I\u0026rsquo;m trying to address some discussion points and misconceptions about the KNOB attack.\nAttribution  Researchers from CISPA discovered the KNOB attack\n Partially true. The KNOB attack was discovered by myself (Daniele Antonioli) from SUTD, Nils Ole Tippenhauer from CISPA, and Kasper Rasmussen from the University of Oxford. In particular, I\u0026rsquo;ve identified the vulnerability back in May 2018 while I was working with Kasper on Nearby Connections at the University of Oxford, and I wrote the first exploit in October 2018 while I was visiting Nils (my former advisor at SUTD) at CISPA. I\u0026rsquo;d like to thank the researchers from CISPA who kindly lent me their Bluetooth devices.\nAttack  The KNOB attack is performed while two Bluetooth BR/EDR devices are pairing\n False. The KNOB attack targets the connection phase and can be conducted between two devices are already paired. See also slide 6\n The KNOB attack can only be used to spy Bluetooth communications\n Partially true. The KNOB attack can also be used to inject valid ciphertext, e.g., to impersonate a legitimate Bluetooth device.\n The KNOB attack reduces the encryption key size to 1 byte\n False. The encryption key size stays the same (16 bytes). The KNOB attack reduces the entropy (randomness) of the key to 1 byte. For example the key 0xa395a045bf2410983b4309214598beaf (16 byte of entropy) is reduced to 0xa3000000000000000000000000000000 (1 byte of entropy) and not to 0xa3.\n The KNOB attack is theoretical\n False. The KNOB attack exploits an actual vulnerability in the key negotiation protocol of Bluetooth (BR/EDR). As it is an attack at the architectural level, all standard compliant devices are potentially vulnerable. Back in 2018 we performed the KNOB attack on more than 20 Bluetooth devices, and all of them were vulnerable. You can test if your device is vulnerable by using our PoC.\n The attacker has to be \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; or in a \u0026ldquo;privileged\u0026rdquo; position\n False. The KNOB attack can be conducted remotely. For obvious reasons the attacker has to be in Bluetooth range, but this does not imply a privileged position.\n Internalblue enabled the discovery of the KNOB attack\n False. I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered the vulnerability while I was analyzing Nearby Connections and reading the Bluetooth specification in May 2018. Then, while I was looking at devices with an open source Bluetooth firmware, I\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled upon the Internalblue v0.1. To implement the attack I had to extend Internalblue to support LMP packet injection, and develop some extra code for E0. Nevertheless, Internalblue is an awesome project, I recommend it, and I thank Dennis and Jiska for releasing it to the public.\nImplementation  The researchers did not implement the attack\n False. We implemented the KNOB attack and our implementation generates the same effects of a remote KNOB attack conducted over the air. This is nice because we have a reliable and cheap attack setup that can be reproduced without the need of signal manipulation and jamming techniques, and SDR. If you want to reproduce the attack look at our repo.\n The researchers implemented only the firmware attack\n False. We implement the remote attack by patching the firmware of one of the victim devices (Nexus 5). Our patches simulate the effect of a remote MitM attack and they do not change any firmware logic. This allows us to test the effect of a remote MitM attack on actual devices without having to perform the attack over the air.\n","date":1566172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566172800,"objectID":"c539b3906c747951a051322dd0db80c2","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/knob-faq/","publishdate":"2019-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/knob-faq/","section":"post","summary":"In this post I\u0026rsquo;m trying to address some discussion points and misconceptions about the KNOB attack.\nAttribution  Researchers from CISPA discovered the KNOB attack\n Partially true.

Wireless systems are used to transmit (sensitive) information and to manage and monitor systems remotely. In our recent works we focus on three problems to advance the security of wireless systems: effectiveness of deployed physical layer features as defense mechanisms, complexity and accessibility of wireless technologies, and security evaluations of wireless protocols. Firstly, we present a theoretical and empirical comparisons between b/n/ac amendments of IEEE 802.11 (WLAN). Our goal is to estimate and measure whether or not modern physical layer features, such as MIMO and beamforming, could be used to as defense mechanism. Afterwards, we will talk about our security analysis of Nearby Connections, a proprietary API for proximity-based services developed by Google. This API uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and it is included in all Android devices since version 4.0 and all Android Things devices. Our analysis uncovers the proprietary (security) mechanisms of Nearby Connections and it is based on our reverse-engineering of its implementation. We demonstrate that Nearby Connections is vulnerable to critical threats by implementing attacks where we maliciously manipulate Nearby Connections and we extend the connection range to devices that are not nearby. Prior to publication we disclosed our findings to Google and we suggested them effective countermeasures. In the last part of the presentation we will summarize our contributions in the area of cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular we will introduce MiniCPS, a toolkit for real-time CPS simulation and emulation and its related projects and use cases.\n ","date":1560137316,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560137316,"objectID":"4c0f935959ab2b10ecadf9e2835594ee","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/phd-defense/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T11:28:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/phd-defense/","section":"post","summary":"Soon I\u0026rsquo;m going to defend my PhD thesis at SUTD.

The attack allows a third party, without knowledge of any secret material (such as link and encryption keys), to make two (or more) victims agree on an encryption key with only 1 byte (8 bits) of entropy. Such low entropy enables the attacker to easily brute force the negotiated encryption keys, decrypt the eavesdropped ciphertext, and inject valid encrypted messages (in real-time). The attack is stealthy because the encryption key negotiation is transparent to the Bluetooth users. The attack is standard-compliant because all Bluetooth BR/EDR versions require to support encryption keys with entropy between 1 and 16 bytes and do not secure the key negotiation protocol. As a result, the attacker completely breaks Bluetooth BR/EDR security without being detected. We call our attack Key Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack. The attack targets the firmware of the Bluetooth chip because the firmware (Bluetooth controller) implements all the security features of Bluetooth BR/EDR. As a standard-compliant attack, it is expected to be effective on any firmware that follows the specification and on any device using a vulnerable firmware. We describe how to perform the KNOB attack, and we implement it. We evaluate our implementation on more than 14 Bluetooth chips from popular manufacturers such as Intel, Broadcom, Apple, and Qualcomm. Our results demonstrate that all tested devices are vulnerable to the KNOB attack. We discuss countermeasures to fix the Bluetooth specification and its implementation.","tags":null,"title":"The KNOB is Broken: Exploiting Low Entropy in the Encryption Key Negotiation of Bluetooth BR/EDR","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This week I\u0026rsquo;ve been in San Diego CA for the The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2019 conference.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve presented our paper about Nearby Threats: Reversing, Analyzing, and Attacking Google’s ‘Nearby Connections’ on Android.\nPlease have a look at the slides, at the, Soft AP manipulation PoC and the reddit thread.\n","date":1551151716,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551151716,"objectID":"a0301f94fea79aa49e94faff30ea3c2e","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/ndss19-conf/","publishdate":"2019-02-26T11:28:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/ndss19-conf/","section":"post","summary":"This week I\u0026rsquo;ve been in San Diego CA for the The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2019 conference.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve presented our paper about Nearby Threats: Reversing, Analyzing, and Attacking Google’s ‘Nearby Connections’ on Android.","tags":["paper","ndss"],"title":"NDSS 2019 in San Diego","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve accepted the invitation to join the IEEE CPS-SEC workshop TPC.

The implementation of the API is proprietary, closed-source and obfuscated. The updates of the API are automatically installed by Google across different versions  of  Android,  without  user  interaction.

We propose state-aware anomaly detection that uses state dependent detection thresholds, which provide tighter constraints for an attacker trying to manipulate the process. In particular, our system provides: (i) estimation of system state from the knowl- edge of the network and the physical process (ii) a state-aware cumulative sum of residuals for monitoring the industrial control system (iii) and a novel state-aware anomaly detection technique.  We implement and evaluate our anomaly detection technique on a real-world ICS. We pre-compute the process-state parameters using a big data framework for ICS and train the detector leveraging more than 120 GB of historical data from the ICS.

Our gamification idea resulted in the design and implementation of the SWaT Security Showdown (S3). S3 is a Capture-The-Flag event specifically targeted at Industrial Control Systems security. We developed ICS-specific challenges involving both theoretical and applied ICS security concepts. The participants had access to a real water treatment facility and they interacted with simulated components and ICS honeypots. S3 includes international teams of attackers and defenders both from academia and industry. It was conducted in two phases. The online phase (a jeopardy-style capture the flag event) served as a training session and presented novel categories not found in traditional information security CTFs. The live phase (an attack-defense CTF) involved teams testing new attack and defense techniques on SWaT: our water treatment testbed. During the competition we acted as judges, and we assigned points to the attacker teams according to a scoring system that we developed internally. Our scoring system is based on multiple factors, including realistic ICS attacker models and effectiveness of the detection mechanisms of the defenders.

In particular, we investigate the downlink of 802.11 networks in infrastructure mode (e. g. from an access point to a terminal) using Commercial-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) devices. Recent 802.11n/ac amendments introduced several physical and link layer features, such as MIMO, spatial diversity, and frame aggregation, to increase the throughput and the capacity of the channel. Several information theoretical studies state that some of those 802.11n/ac features (e. g. beamforming) should provide a degradation of performance for a passive eavesdropper. However, the real impact of those features has not yet been analyzed in a practical context and experimentally evaluated. We present a theoretical discussion and a statistical analysis (using path loss models) to estimate the effects of such features on a passive eavesdropper in 802.11n/ac, using 802.11b as a baseline. We use Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and Packet-Error-Rate (PER) as our main metrics. We compute lower and upper bounds for the expected SNR difference between 802.11b and 802.11n/ac using high-level wireless channel characteristics. We show that the PER in 802.11n/ac increases up to 98% (compared to 802.11b) at a distance of 20 meters between the sender and the eavesdropper. To obtain a PER of 0.5 in 802.11n/ac, the attacker’s maximal distance is reduced by up to 129.5 m compared to 802.11b. We perform an extensive set of experiments, using COTS devices in an indoor office environment, to verify our theoretical estimations. The experimental results validate our predicted effects and show that every amendment add extra resiliency against passive COTS eavesdropping.","tags":null,"title":"Practical Evaluation of Passive COTS Eavesdropping in 802.11b/n/ac WLAN","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m happy to announce that my poster titled Towards high-interaction virtual ICS honeypots-in-a-box won the ST Engineering Poster Award at the FIRST industry workshop, held at SUTD.

In particular, we were introduced to Singapore cybersecurity strategies and long-term plans.Then we heard the personal story of a cybersecurity startup founder and we discovered common and effective threats in the cybersecurity landscape. Finally, we heard two presentations from two SUTD cybersecurity professors about novel cybersecurity problems and solutions, such as cyber-physical systems, IoT and adversarial machine learning. We understood the importance of education and awareness when talking about cybersecurity.\nAfter lunch we visited SUTD\u0026rsquo;s world-class cybersecurity facilites. We started from iTrust, SUTD\u0026rsquo;s cybersecurity research centre. iTrust covers a broad range of topics spanning from theoretical to applied cybersecurity. The range of research area covered spans from traditional computer security to domain-specific areas such as: industrial control systems, Internet of Things, and autonomous vehicles.\niTrust in collaboration with the Singapore government and private industries has developed four state-of-the-art testbeds. Those testbed allow researchers to apply and evaluate their ideas in realistic and safe environment. We now briefly comment of each of the testbed. The Secure Water Treatment testbed is the oldest and it includes advanced sub-processes such as Ultrafiltration and Reverse Osmosis. The water treated by SWaT is one of the sources of the second oldest testbed: the Water Distribution (WaDi) testbed. WaDi is a miniaturized reproduction of a water distribution facility with six consumers tanks with independent demands patters. WaDi can be used to simulated water leakages, water-hammer attacks and water contamination. Both SWaT and WaDi can be powered by EPIC the smart grid testbed. EPIC is the newest and less-know testbed at SUTD and several researchers are actively working to evaluate it. Finally, we visited the Internet-of-Things testbed that includes an anechoic chamber to perform radio tests and several Commercial-Off-The-Shelf devices (such as IP camera, smart thermostats and smart lamps) to recreate a smart home environment.\nOverall it was a very rich experience.

Honeypots are vulnerable systems that are set up with the intent to be probed and compromised by attackers. Analysis of those attacks then allows the defender to learn about novel attacks and general strategy of the attacker. Honeypots for ICS systems need to satisfy both traditional ICT requirements, such as cost and maintainability, and more specific ICS requirements, such as time and determinism. We propose the design of a virtual, high-interaction and server-based ICS honeypot to satisfy the requirements, and the deployment of a realistic, cost-effective, and maintainable ICS honeypot. An attacker model is introduced to complete the problem statement and requirements. Based on our design and the MiniCPS framework, we implemented a honeypot mimicking a water treatment testbed. To the best of our knowledge, the presented honeypot implementation is the first academic work targeting Ethernet/IP based ICS honeypots, the first ICS virtual honeypot that is high-interactive without the use of full virtualization technologies (such as a network of virtual machines), and the first ICS honeypot that can be managed with a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller.","tags":null,"title":"Towards high-interaction virtual ICS honeypots-in-a-box","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

While a great amount of research has been conducted on network security of office and home networks, recently the security of CPS and related systems has gained increased attention. Unfortunately, real-world CPS are often not open to security researchers, and as a result very few reference physical-layer processes, control systems and communication topologies are available. In this work, we present MiniCPS, a toolkit intended to alleviate this problem. The goal of MiniCPS is to create an extensible, reproducible research environment for network communications, control systems, and physical-layer interactions in CPS. Instead of focusing on a customized simulation settings for specific subsystems, the main goal is to establish a framework to connect together real CPS soft- and hardware, simulation scripts for such components, and physical-layer simulation engines. MiniCPS builds on Mininet to provide lightweight real-time network emulation, and extends Mininet with tools to simulate typical CPS components such as programmable logic controllers, which use industrial protocols (eg. EtherNet/IP, Modbus/TCP). To capture physical-layer interactions, MiniCPS defines a simple API to connect to physical-layer simulations. We demonstrate applications of MiniCPS in two example scenarios, and show how MiniCPS can be used to develop attacks and defenses that are directly applicable to real systems.","tags":null,"title":"MiniCPS: A toolkit for security research on CPS networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

These devices require low cost test methodologies and security against cryptanalytic and invasive attacks. In this work we propose an on-chip implementation of a reduced set of NIST-SP-800-22 randomness test suite to provide on-line RNG testing for low cost security devices along with runtime monitoring of RNG performance. The on-chip NIST module monitors the effect of dynamic variation of operating condition and time dependent wear-out on RNG circuits. It indicates invasive attacks on RNG and allows the secure system to take protective measures. Six NIST tests are optimized to a hardware design friendly format, but in compliance with the NIST standard. The lightweight implementations reduce complex statistical and arithmetic operations of conventional NIST tests to a series of bit stream count and compare operations. A cycle-to-cycle serial test of incoming bits from RNG eliminates need for additional storage. A partial re-configurable feature is designed to set the pass/fail threshold for each test depending on the system requirements. The on-chip NIST module, although not exhaustive, is an effective layer of validation and security for RNG circuits. The six 128-bit tests implemented in 45nm NCSU PDK have a total synthesized area of ~1926.sq.um for an optimized frequency of 2GHz. The total dynamic power is 3.75mW and leakage power is 10.5μW. At 2Gbps, the NIST module consumes 1.87pJ/bit. The lightweight ultra-low power implementation is scalable for larger input bit samples.","tags":null,"title":"On-chip lightweight implementation of reduced NIST randomness test suite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.
