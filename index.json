Wireless systems are used to transmit (sensitive) information and to manage and monitor systems remotely. In our recent works we focus on three problems to advance the security of wireless systems: effectiveness of deployed physical layer features as defense mechanisms, complexity and accessibility of wireless technologies, and security evaluations of wireless protocols. Firstly, we present a theoretical and empirical comparisons between b/n/ac amendments of IEEE 802.11 (WLAN). Our goal is to estimate and measure whether or not modern physical layer features, such as MIMO and beamforming, could be used to as defense mechanism. Afterwards, we will talk about our security analysis of Nearby Connections, a proprietary API for proximity-based services developed by Google. This API uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and it is included in all Android devices since version 4.0 and all Android Things devices. Our analysis uncovers the proprietary (security) mechanisms of Nearby Connections and it is based on our reverse-engineering of its implementation. We demonstrate that Nearby Connections is vulnerable to critical threats by implementing attacks where we maliciously manipulate Nearby Connections and we extend the connection range to devices that are not nearby. Prior to publication we disclosed our findings to Google and we suggested them effective countermeasures. In the last part of the presentation we will summarize our contributions in the area of cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular we will introduce MiniCPS, a toolkit for real-time CPS simulation and emulation and its related projects and use cases.\n ","date":1560137316,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560137316,"objectID":"4c0f935959ab2b10ecadf9e2835594ee","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/phd-defense/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T11:28:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/phd-defense/","section":"post","summary":"Soon I\u0026rsquo;m going to defend my PhD thesis at SUTD.

The scientific evolution of digital, analog, and physical components with the interactions between networks created the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Even though the benefits of the cyber and physical world interactions are noticeable, new security challenges have arisen: typical vulnerabilities from the cyber domain emerged in CPS. Cyber-attacks over CPS pose different security challenges. In particular, classic Information Technology (IT) cyber security tools are considered partially or totally ineffective in CPS scenarios because complex cyber-physical attacks could avoid security detection methodologies developed specifically for the IT world. The prevention, detection, and mitigation of cyber-attacks encompass both the physical and the cyber layers of a system: to this end, approaches to securing CPS consider techniques adopted in the physical domain and in the cyber space.\nFollowing the success of the previous editions, the IEEE International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security 2019 (CPS-Sec 2019) aims to represent a forum for researchers and practitioners from industry and academia interested in the areas of CPS security.

The API uses Bluetooth BR/EDR, Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi to let “nearby”  clients  (discoverers)  and  servers  (advertisers)  connect and exchange different types of payloads. The implementation of the API is proprietary, closed-source and obfuscated. The updates of the API are automatically installed by Google across different versions  of  Android,  without  user  interaction.  Little  is  known publicly  about  the  security  guarantees  offered  by  the  API,  even though  it  presents  a  significant  attack  surface. In  this  work  we  present  the  first  security  analysis  of  the Google’s Nearby Connections API, based on reverse-engineering of  its  Android  implementation.  We  discover  and  implement  several  attacks  grouped  into  two  families:  connection  manipulation (CMA) and range extension attacks (REA). CMA-attacks allow an attacker to insert himself as a man-in-the-middle and manipulate connections  (even  unrelated  to  nearby),  and  to  tamper  with the victim’s  interface  and  network  configuration.  REA-attacks allow  an  attacker  to  tunnel  any  nearby  connection  to  remote locations,  even  between  two  honest  devices.  Our  attacks  are enabled  by  REArby,  a  toolkit  we  developed  while  reversing the  API  implementation.  REArby  includes  a  dynamic  binary instrumenter,  a  packet  dissector,  and  the  implementations of custom  Nearby  Connections  client  and  server.

We propose state-aware anomaly detection that uses state dependent detection thresholds, which provide tighter constraints for an attacker trying to manipulate the process. In particular, our system provides: (i) estimation of system state from the knowl- edge of the network and the physical process (ii) a state-aware cumulative sum of residuals for monitoring the industrial control system (iii) and a novel state-aware anomaly detection technique.  We implement and evaluate our anomaly detection technique on a real-world ICS. We pre-compute the process-state parameters using a big data framework for ICS and train the detector leveraging more than 120 GB of historical data from the ICS. The results show that the proposed method improves prior works by providing less time-to-detect of attacks while generating fewer false alarms.","tags":null,"title":"State-Aware Anomaly Detection for Industrial Control Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"After the post about connecting to SUTD\u0026rsquo;s VPN is now time to connect eduroam!

Our gamification idea resulted in the design and implementation of the SWaT Security Showdown (S3). S3 is a Capture-The-Flag event specifically targeted at Industrial Control Systems security. We developed ICS-specific challenges involving both theoretical and applied ICS security concepts. The participants had access to a real water treatment facility and they interacted with simulated components and ICS honeypots. S3 includes international teams of attackers and defenders both from academia and industry. It was conducted in two phases. The online phase (a jeopardy-style capture the flag event) served as a training session and presented novel categories not found in traditional information security CTFs. The live phase (an attack-defense CTF) involved teams testing new attack and defense techniques on SWaT: our water treatment testbed. During the competition we acted as judges, and we assigned points to the attacker teams according to a scoring system that we developed internally. Our scoring system is based on multiple factors, including realistic ICS attacker models and effectiveness of the detection mechanisms of the defenders.

In particular, we investigate the downlink of 802.11 networks in infrastructure mode (e. g. from an access point to a terminal) using Commercial-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) devices. Recent 802.11n/ac amendments introduced several physical and link layer features, such as MIMO, spatial diversity, and frame aggregation, to increase the throughput and the capacity of the channel. Several information theoretical studies state that some of those 802.11n/ac features (e. g. beamforming) should provide a degradation of performance for a passive eavesdropper. However, the real impact of those features has not yet been analyzed in a practical context and experimentally evaluated. We present a theoretical discussion and a statistical analysis (using path loss models) to estimate the effects of such features on a passive eavesdropper in 802.11n/ac, using 802.11b as a baseline. We use Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and Packet-Error-Rate (PER) as our main metrics. We compute lower and upper bounds for the expected SNR difference between 802.11b and 802.11n/ac using high-level wireless channel characteristics. We show that the PER in 802.11n/ac increases up to 98% (compared to 802.11b) at a distance of 20 meters between the sender and the eavesdropper. To obtain a PER of 0.5 in 802.11n/ac, the attacker’s maximal distance is reduced by up to 129.5 m compared to 802.11b. We perform an extensive set of experiments, using COTS devices in an indoor office environment, to verify our theoretical estimations. The experimental results validate our predicted effects and show that every amendment add extra resiliency against passive COTS eavesdropping.","tags":null,"title":"Practical Evaluation of Passive COTS Eavesdropping in 802.11b/n/ac WLAN","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m happy to announce that my poster titled Towards high-interaction virtual ICS honeypots-in-a-box won the ST Engineering Poster Award at the FIRST industry workshop, held at SUTD.

In particular, we were introduced to Singapore cybersecurity strategies and long-term plans.Then we heard the personal story of a cybersecurity startup founder and we discovered common and effective threats in the cybersecurity landscape. Finally, we heard two presentations from two SUTD cybersecurity professors about novel cybersecurity problems and solutions, such as cyber-physical systems, IoT and adversarial machine learning. We understood the importance of education and awareness when talking about cybersecurity.\nAfter lunch we visited SUTD\u0026rsquo;s world-class cybersecurity facilites. We started from iTrust, SUTD\u0026rsquo;s cybersecurity research centre. iTrust covers a broad range of topics spanning from theoretical to applied cybersecurity. The range of research area covered spans from traditional computer security to domain-specific areas such as: industrial control systems, Internet of Things, and autonomous vehicles.\niTrust in collaboration with the Singapore government and private industries has developed four state-of-the-art testbeds. Those testbed allow researchers to apply and evaluate their ideas in realistic and safe environment. We now briefly comment of each of the testbed. The Secure Water Treatment testbed is the oldest and it includes advanced sub-processes such as Ultrafiltration and Reverse Osmosis. The water treated by SWaT is one of the sources of the second oldest testbed: the Water Distribution (WaDi) testbed. WaDi is a miniaturized reproduction of a water distribution facility with six consumers tanks with independent demands patters. WaDi can be used to simulated water leakages, water-hammer attacks and water contamination. Both SWaT and WaDi can be powered by EPIC the smart grid testbed. EPIC is the newest and less-know testbed at SUTD and several researchers are actively working to evaluate it. Finally, we visited the Internet-of-Things testbed that includes an anechoic chamber to perform radio tests and several Commercial-Off-The-Shelf devices (such as IP camera, smart thermostats and smart lamps) to recreate a smart home environment.\nOverall it was a very rich experience.

Honeypots are vulnerable systems that are set up with the intent to be probed and compromised by attackers. Analysis of those attacks then allows the defender to learn about novel attacks and general strategy of the attacker. Honeypots for ICS systems need to satisfy both traditional ICT requirements, such as cost and maintainability, and more specific ICS requirements, such as time and determinism. We propose the design of a virtual, high-interaction and server-based ICS honeypot to satisfy the requirements, and the deployment of a realistic, cost-effective, and maintainable ICS honeypot. An attacker model is introduced to complete the problem statement and requirements. Based on our design and the MiniCPS framework, we implemented a honeypot mimicking a water treatment testbed. To the best of our knowledge, the presented honeypot implementation is the first academic work targeting Ethernet/IP based ICS honeypots, the first ICS virtual honeypot that is high-interactive without the use of full virtualization technologies (such as a network of virtual machines), and the first ICS honeypot that can be managed with a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller.","tags":null,"title":"Towards high-interaction virtual ICS honeypots-in-a-box","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

While a great amount of research has been conducted on network security of office and home networks, recently the security of CPS and related systems has gained increased attention. Unfortunately, real-world CPS are often not open to security researchers, and as a result very few reference physical-layer processes, control systems and communication topologies are available. In this work, we present MiniCPS, a toolkit intended to alleviate this problem. The goal of MiniCPS is to create an extensible, reproducible research environment for network communications, control systems, and physical-layer interactions in CPS. Instead of focusing on a customized simulation settings for specific subsystems, the main goal is to establish a framework to connect together real CPS soft- and hardware, simulation scripts for such components, and physical-layer simulation engines. MiniCPS builds on Mininet to provide lightweight real-time network emulation, and extends Mininet with tools to simulate typical CPS components such as programmable logic controllers, which use industrial protocols (eg. EtherNet/IP, Modbus/TCP). To capture physical-layer interactions, MiniCPS defines a simple API to connect to physical-layer simulations. We demonstrate applications of MiniCPS in two example scenarios, and show how MiniCPS can be used to develop attacks and defenses that are directly applicable to real systems.","tags":null,"title":"MiniCPS: A toolkit for security research on CPS networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

These devices require low cost test methodologies and security against cryptanalytic and invasive attacks. In this work we propose an on-chip implementation of a reduced set of NIST-SP-800-22 randomness test suite to provide on-line RNG testing for low cost security devices along with runtime monitoring of RNG performance. The on-chip NIST module monitors the effect of dynamic variation of operating condition and time dependent wear-out on RNG circuits. It indicates invasive attacks on RNG and allows the secure system to take protective measures. Six NIST tests are optimized to a hardware design friendly format, but in compliance with the NIST standard. The lightweight implementations reduce complex statistical and arithmetic operations of conventional NIST tests to a series of bit stream count and compare operations. A cycle-to-cycle serial test of incoming bits from RNG eliminates need for additional storage. A partial re-configurable feature is designed to set the pass/fail threshold for each test depending on the system requirements. The on-chip NIST module, although not exhaustive, is an effective layer of validation and security for RNG circuits. The six 128-bit tests implemented in 45nm NCSU PDK have a total synthesized area of ~1926.sq.um for an optimized frequency of 2GHz. The total dynamic power is 3.75mW and leakage power is 10.5μW. At 2Gbps, the NIST module consumes 1.87pJ/bit.
