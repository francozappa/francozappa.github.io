Successful attacks on its fitness tracking ecosystem would result in severe consequences, including the loss of sensitive health and personal data. Despite these relevant risks, we know very little about the security mechanisms adopted by Xiaomi. In this work, we uncover them and show that they are insecure. In particular, Xiaomi protects its fitness tracking ecosystem with custom application-layer protocols spoken over insecure Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) connections (ignoring standard BLE security mechanisms already supported by their devices) and TLS connections. We identify severe vulnerabilities affecting such proprietary protocols, including unilateral and replayable authentication.\nThose issues are critical as they affect all Xiaomi trackers released since 2016 and up-to-date Xiaomi companion apps for Android and iOS. We show in practice how to exploit the identified vulnerabilities by presenting six impactful attacks. Four attacks enable to wirelessly impersonate any Xiaomi fitness tracker and companion app, man-in-the-middle (MitM) them, and eavesdrop on their communication. The other two attacks leverage a malicious Android application to remotely eavesdrop on data from a tracker and impersonate a Xiaomi fitness app.\nOverall, the attacks have a high impact as they can be used to exfiltrate and inject sensitive data from any Xiaomi tracker and compatible app. We propose five practical and low-overhead countermeasures to mitigate the presented vulnerabilities. Moreover, we present BreakMi, a modular toolkit that we developed to automate our reverse-engineering process and attacks. breakmi understands Xiaomi application-layer proprietary protocols, reimplements Xiaomi security mechanisms, and automatically performs our attacks. We demonstrate that our toolkit can be generalized by extending it to be compatible with the Fitbit ecosystem.

Therefore, the main challenge is to identify the critical points of IoT infrastructure. To address this issue, ORSHIN is creating the first generic and integrated methodology, called trusted lifecycle, to develop secure network devices based on open-source components while managing their entire lifecycle. ORSHIN‚Äôs trustworthy lifecycle consists of different phases (design, implementation, evaluation, installation, maintenance and retirement) that form a chain of trust. This lifecycle defines how the safety objectives are translated into policies for defined phases. Using this holistic view, ORSHIN will address critical links, reduce threats and improve security of open-source devices.\nVision The open-source initiative represents a significant shift in the industry, providing the opportunity to share knowledge between industry and research and enabling rapid time-to-market for solutions, but there is still much room for improvement - particularly with a view to cyber security. Therefore, the ORSHIN project team will step together and develop a new approach that will improve cyber security, manage the entire lifecycle of trustworthy network and create a secure infrastructure for connected devices. To meet this challenge ORSHIN will work on building a trusted open-source hardware and software that will significantly reduce the risks associated with IoT devices - from design to its retirement, as a chain of trust called the trusted lifecycle.\nConsortium The ORSHIN consortium consists of seven partners from six European countries.

For example, we show that is trivial to impersonate a trusted smartphone to commercial IVIs using an attack chain that we developed in recent years (KNOB+BIAS attacks). As a result of a successful impersonation, an attacker can exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the IVI and send malicious commands to the IVI without being detected.\nWe note that PLBTs are effective on any Bluetooth-enabled IVI as they exploit protocol flaws in the Bluetooth standard itself. Hence, we expect that the vast majority of the IVIs in the market is vulnerable to the KNOB+BIAS attack chain and other PLBTs.

Offensive security has changed from a hobby to an industry. No longer an exercise for isolated enthusiasts, offensive security is today a large-scale operation managed by organized, capitalized actors. Meanwhile, the landscape has shifted: software used by millions is built by startups less than a year old, delivered on mobile phones and surveilled by national signals intelligence agencies. In the field‚Äôs infancy, offensive security research was conducted separately by industry, independent hackers, or in academia. Collaboration between these groups was difficult. Since 2007, the Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) has been bringing those communities together.\nSymposium Topics Computer security exposes the differences between the actual mechanisms of everyday trusted technologies and their models used by developers, architects, academic researchers, owners, operators, and end users. While being inherently focused on practice, security also poses questions such as ‚Äúwhat kind of computations are and aren‚Äôt trusted systems capable of?‚Äù which harken back to fundamentals of computability. State-of-the-art offense explores these questions pragmatically, gathering material for generalizations that lead to better models and more trustworthy systems.\nWOOT provides a forum for high-quality, peer-reviewed work discussing tools and techniques for attacks. Submissions should reflect the state of the art in offensive computer security technology, exposing poorly understood mechanisms, presenting novel attacks, highlighting the limitations of published attacks and defenses, or surveying the state of offensive operations at scale. WOOT ‚Äò22 accepts papers in both an academic security context and more applied work that informs the field about the state of security practice in offensive techniques. The goal for these submissions is to produce published works that will guide future work in the field. Submissions will be peer reviewed and shepherded as appropriate. Submission topics include, but are not limited to, attacks on and offensive research into:\nHardware, including software-based exploitation of hardware vulnerabilities Virtualization and the cloud Network and distributed systems Operating systems Browser and general client-side security (runtimes, JITs, sandboxing) Application security Analysis of mitigations and automating how they can be bypassed Automating software testing such as fuzzing for novel targets Internet of Things Machine Learning Cyber-physical systems Privacy Cryptographic systems (practical attacks on deployed systems) Malware design, implementation and analysis Offensive applications of formal methods (solvers, symbolic execution) Workshop Format The presenters will be authors of accepted papers. There will also be a keynote speaker and a selection of invited speakers. WOOT ‚Äò22 will feature a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award.\nNote that WOOT\u0026#39;22 and other IEEE S\u0026amp;P workshops are planned to be held in person, see the IEEE S\u0026amp;P website for details and updates.\nRegular Submission WOOT ‚Äò22 welcomes submissions without restrictions of origin. Submissions from academia, independent researchers, students, hackers, and industry are welcome. Are you planning to give a cool talk at Black Hat in August? Got something interesting planned for other non-academic venues later this year? This is exactly the type of work we‚Äôd like to see at WOOT ‚Äò22. Please submit ‚Äì it will also give you a chance to have your work reviewed and to receive suggestions and comments from some of the best researchers in the world. More formal academic offensive security papers are also very welcome.\nSystematization of Knowledge Continuing the tradition of past years, WOOT ‚Äò22 will be accepting ‚ÄúSystematization of Knowledge‚Äù (SoK) papers. The goal of an SoK paper is to encourage work that evaluates, systematizes, and contextualizes existing knowledge. These papers will prove highly valuable to our community but would not be accepted as refereed papers because they lack novel research contributions. Suitable papers include survey papers that provide useful perspectives on major research areas, papers that support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, or papers that provide an extensive and realistic evaluation of competing approaches to solving specific problems. Be sure to select ‚ÄúSystematization of Knowledge paper‚Äù in the submissions system to distinguish it from other paper submissions.\nSubmission Requirements Paper submission deadline: Thursday, January 27, 2022, 11:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) Notification ‚Ä¶","date":1642809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642809600,"objectID":"4ec068460ceefb6266ea70aca6e33088","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/2022/cfp-woot22/","publishdate":"2022-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2022/cfp-woot22/","section":"post","summary":"The WOOT'22 CFP is open.

Bluetooth runs on billions of devices, including mobile, wearables, home automation, smart speakers, headsets, industrial and medical appliances, and vehicles. As a result, Bluetooth‚Äôs attack surface is huge and includes significant threats such as identity thefts, privacy violations, and malicious device control.\nBluetooth is a complex technology specified in an open standard. The standard defines two wireless stacks Bluetooth ‚Äúclassic‚Äù BR/EDR for high throughput services (e.g., audio and voice) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for very low power services (e.g., localization, and monitoring). The standard defines security mechanisms to protect Bluetooth communications. Those mechanisms include pairing to share a long term key among two devices, and secure session establishment to let two paired devices negotiate session keys. It is paramount that those standard security mechanisms provide security guarantees that they promise, such as confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of data. A single vulnerability in a standard security mechanism translates into billions of exploitable devices.\nThis talk describes how we managed to find and exploit standard-compliant 0-days in the Bluetooth standard. We describe, in detail, the Bluetooth security architecture, including its main components (Host, Controller) and protocols (HCI, LMP, and SMP). Then we talk about the Key Negotiation of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack on Bluetooth ‚Äúclassic‚Äù BR/EDR [CVE-2019-9506] and its extension to BLE. The KNOB attacks are enabled by standard-compliant 0-days in the key negotiation protocols of Bluetooth ‚Äúclassic‚Äù BR/EDR and BLE. In particular, those protocols allow to negotiate keys with very low entropy (strength), and they do not protect the integrity of entropy negotiation. Using the KNOB attack, a man-in-the-middle attacker can force a Bluetooth ‚Äúclassic‚Äù BR/EDR session key to 1 byte of entropy, and a BLE long term key to 7 bytes of entropy. Such low entropy values are unacceptable in 2020 and can easily (for BLE) or trivially (for BR/EDR) be brute-forced.\nAs a result of our attacks, a remote attacker gets access to private data and inserts valid malicious data on Bluetooth ‚Äúclassic‚Äù BR/EDR and BLE secure connection. The exploits are effective on any standard compliant Bluetooth device regardless of software, hardware vendors and versions, Bluetooth version, supported security features, or security mode in use. As a result of our disclosure in 2019, the Bluetooth SIG amended the standard by requiring 7 bytes of entropy as minimum entropy value for Bluetooth BR/EDR (as for BLE). Only some vendors, including Intel, Google, Apple, and Microsoft, patched a subset of their products to address the KNOB attack, and in the talk, we describe some of those patches and why they are not effective. We also describe why the majority of low-end devices that we tested remains vulnerable to the 1-byte entropy downgrade. We conclude the talk describing the main lessons that we learned while finding and exploiting Bluetooth standard compliant 0 days.\nThe KNOB attacks were identified, investigated, and demonstrated by Daniele Antonioli, Nils Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen, more information at https://knobattack.com.\n","date":1588204800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588204800,"objectID":"c7166df52d170d839935c954aae75a94","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/talk/from-the-bluetooth-standard-to-standard-compliant-0-days/","publishdate":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/from-the-bluetooth-standard-to-standard-compliant-0-days/","section":"event","summary":"Bluetooth is a ubiquitous technology for low power wireless communications.

CPS are composed or sensors, actuators and controllers, and they are used to manage different processes such as industrial plants. Securing CPS is an open challenge and attacks such as Stuxnet and TRITON have reiterated the importance of securing CPS. In this work we focus on three (intertwined) problems to advance the security of CPS, namely technologies and processes, multi-disciplinary communities, and threat models and incentives. To address these problems we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of MiniCPS, an open-source toolkit for lightweight and real-time simulation of CPS. MiniCPS is built on top of Mininet, a network emulator based on Linux containers. We explore the usability of MiniCPS to develop defense mechanisms for CPS, with a particular emphasis on honeypots. A honeypot is a virtual or physical replica of a real system deployed to detect, mitigate and counteract cyber attacks. We leverage MiniCPS to design, implement and evaluate a novel high-interaction honeypot for industrial control systems. In addition, we test the effectiveness of MiniCPS as an educational and experimentation tool to help cybersecurity researchers and professionals. In particular, we used MiniCPS to design novel cybersecurity challenges based on real-time simulations of CPS. The challenges were proposed in a gamified security competition that we designed called SWaT Security Showdown (S3). The second part of the dissertation presents our contributions in the area of wireless systems security. Wireless systems are used to transmit (sensitive) information and to manage and monitor systems remotely. In this work we focus on three problems to advance the security of wireless systems, namely effectiveness of deployed physical layer features as defense mechanisms, complexity and accessibility of wireless technologies, and security evaluations of wireless protocols. Firstly, we present a comparison between b/n/ac amendments of IEEE 802.11 (WLAN) where we theoretically estimate and empirically measure that recent physical layer features, such as MIMO and beamforming, could be used to mitigate passive eavesdropping attacks. These features are already present in commercial devices and they are complementary to the other (upper-layer) security mechanisms. Then, we present the first security analysis of Nearby Connections, an API for proximity-based services developed by Google. The API uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and it is included in all Android devices since version 4.0 and all Android Things devices. Our analysis uncovers the proprietary (security) mechanisms of Nearby Connections and it is based on our reverse-engineering of its implementation. We demonstrate attacks where we maliciously manipulate Nearby Connections, and we extend the connection range to devices that are not nearby. Prior to publication we disclosed our findings to Google and we suggested them effective countermeasures. Finally, we describe how we found and exploited an architectural vulnerability of Bluetooth BR/EDR. We show how an attacker can downgrade the entropy any Bluetooth BR/EDR encryption key to 1 byte without being detected, and brute force the low entropy key in real time. We call our attack the Key Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack. We implement the attack and evaluate it on 21 Bluetooth vulnerable devices and we recommended to the Bluetooth SIG effective countermeasures.","tags":["phd thesis wireless cyber-physical"],"title":"Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of Secure Cyber-Physical and Wireless Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I‚Äôm glad to announce that I‚Äôve completed my PhD in Computer Science at SUTD about Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of Secure Cyber-Physical and Wireless Systems.

The KNOB attack was discovered by myself (Daniele Antonioli) from SUTD, Nils Ole Tippenhauer from CISPA, and Kasper Rasmussen from the University of Oxford. In particular, I‚Äôve identified the vulnerability back in May 2018 while I was working with Kasper on Nearby Connections at the University of Oxford, and I wrote the first exploit in October 2018 while I was visiting Nils (my former advisor at SUTD) at CISPA. I‚Äôd like to thank the researchers from CISPA who kindly lent me their Bluetooth devices.\nAttack The KNOB attack is performed while two Bluetooth BR/EDR devices are pairing\nFalse. The KNOB attack targets the connection phase and can be conducted between two devices are already paired. See also slide 6\nThe KNOB attack can only be used to spy Bluetooth communications\nPartially true. The KNOB attack can also be used to inject valid ciphertext, e.g., to impersonate a legitimate Bluetooth device.\nThe KNOB attack reduces the encryption key size to 1 byte\nFalse. The encryption key size stays the same (16 bytes). The KNOB attack reduces the entropy (randomness) of the key to 1 byte. For example the key 0xa395a045bf2410983b4309214598beaf (16 byte of entropy) is reduced to 0xa3000000000000000000000000000000 (1 byte of entropy) and not to 0xa3.\nThe KNOB attack is theoretical\nFalse. The KNOB attack exploits an actual vulnerability in the key negotiation protocol of Bluetooth (BR/EDR). As it is an attack at the architectural level, all standard compliant devices are potentially vulnerable. Back in 2018 we performed the KNOB attack on more than 20 Bluetooth devices, and all of them were vulnerable. You can test if your device is vulnerable by using our PoC.\nThe attacker has to be ‚Äúlocal‚Äù or in a ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù position\nFalse. The KNOB attack can be conducted remotely. For obvious reasons the attacker has to be in Bluetooth range, but this does not imply a privileged position.\nInternalblue enabled the discovery of the KNOB attack\nFalse. I‚Äôve discovered the vulnerability while I was analyzing Nearby Connections and reading the Bluetooth specification in May 2018. Then, while I was looking at devices with an open source Bluetooth firmware, I‚Äôve stumbled upon the Internalblue v0.1. To implement the attack I had to extend Internalblue to support LMP packet injection, and develop some extra code for E0. Nevertheless, Internalblue is an awesome project, I recommend it, and I thank Dennis and Jiska for releasing it to the public.\nImplementation The researchers did not implement the attack\nFalse. We implemented the KNOB attack and our implementation generates the same effects of a remote KNOB attack conducted over the air. This is nice because we have a reliable and cheap attack setup that can be reproduced without the need of signal manipulation and jamming techniques, and SDR. If you want to reproduce the attack look at our repo.\nThe researchers implemented only the firmware attack\nFalse. We implement the remote attack by patching the firmware of one of the victim devices (Nexus 5). Our patches simulate the effect of a remote MitM attack and they do not change any firmware logic. This allows us to test the effect of a remote MitM attack on actual devices without having to perform the attack over the air.\n","date":1566172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566172800,"objectID":"6dfb659a76b41ee4522790d7b92e1510","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/2019/knob-faq/","publishdate":"2019-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019/knob-faq/","section":"post","summary":"In this post I‚Äôm trying to address some discussion points and misconceptions about the KNOB attack.\nAttribution Researchers from CISPA discovered the KNOB attack\nPartially true.

Wireless systems are used to transmit (sensitive) information and to manage and monitor systems remotely. In our recent works we focus on three problems to advance the security of wireless systems: effectiveness of deployed physical layer features as defense mechanisms, complexity and accessibility of wireless technologies, and security evaluations of wireless protocols. Firstly, we present a theoretical and empirical comparisons between b/n/ac amendments of IEEE 802.11 (WLAN). Our goal is to estimate and measure whether or not modern physical layer features, such as MIMO and beamforming, could be used to as defense mechanism. Afterwards, we will talk about our security analysis of Nearby Connections, a proprietary API for proximity-based services developed by Google. This API uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and it is included in all Android devices since version 4.0 and all Android Things devices. Our analysis uncovers the proprietary (security) mechanisms of Nearby Connections and it is based on our reverse-engineering of its implementation. We demonstrate that Nearby Connections is vulnerable to critical threats by implementing attacks where we maliciously manipulate Nearby Connections and we extend the connection range to devices that are not nearby. Prior to publication we disclosed our findings to Google and we suggested them effective countermeasures. In the last part of the presentation we will summarize our contributions in the area of cyber-physical systems (CPS). In particular we will introduce MiniCPS, a toolkit for real-time CPS simulation and emulation and its related projects and use cases.\n","date":1560137316,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560137316,"objectID":"18ba7352e2c52450faa94ce9f23d2c4f","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/2019/phd-defense/","publishdate":"2019-06-10T11:28:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019/phd-defense/","section":"post","summary":"Soon I‚Äôm going to defend my PhD thesis at SUTD.

The attack allows a third party, without knowledge of any secret material (such as link and encryption keys), to make two (or more) victims agree on an encryption key with only 1 byte (8 bits) of entropy. Such low entropy enables the attacker to easily brute force the negotiated encryption keys, decrypt the eavesdropped ciphertext, and inject valid encrypted messages (in real-time). The attack is stealthy because the encryption key negotiation is transparent to the Bluetooth users. The attack is standard-compliant because all Bluetooth BR/EDR versions require to support encryption keys with entropy between 1 and 16 bytes and do not secure the key negotiation protocol. As a result, the attacker completely breaks Bluetooth BR/EDR security without being detected. We call our attack Key Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack. The attack targets the firmware of the Bluetooth chip because the firmware (Bluetooth controller) implements all the security features of Bluetooth BR/EDR. As a standard-compliant attack, it is expected to be effective on any firmware that follows the specification and on any device using a vulnerable firmware. We describe how to perform the KNOB attack, and we implement it. We evaluate our implementation on more than 14 Bluetooth chips from popular manufacturers such as Intel, Broadcom, Apple, and Qualcomm. Our results demonstrate that all tested devices are vulnerable to the KNOB attack. We discuss countermeasures to fix the Bluetooth specification and its implementation.","tags":null,"title":"The KNOB is Broken: Exploiting Low Entropy in the Encryption Key Negotiation of Bluetooth BR/EDR","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This week I‚Äôve been in San Diego CA for the The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2019 conference.\nI‚Äôve presented our paper about Nearby Threats: Reversing, Analyzing, and Attacking Google‚Äôs ‚ÄòNearby Connections‚Äô on Android.\nPlease have a look at the slides, at the, Soft AP manipulation PoC and the reddit thread.\n","date":1551151716,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551151716,"objectID":"13dfc945da82821128b1808e8603ff94","permalink":"https://francozappa.github.io/post/2019/ndss19-conf/","publishdate":"2019-02-26T11:28:36+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/2019/ndss19-conf/","section":"post","summary":"This week I‚Äôve been in San Diego CA for the The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2019 conference.\nI‚Äôve presented our paper about Nearby Threats: Reversing, Analyzing, and Attacking Google‚Äôs ‚ÄòNearby Connections‚Äô on Android.","tags":["paper","ndss"],"title":"NDSS 2019 in San Diego","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Recently, I‚Äôve accepted the invitation to join the IEEE CPS-SEC workshop TPC.

The scientific evolution of digital, analog, and physical components with the interactions between networks created the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS).

We developed ICS-specific challenges involving both theoretical and applied ICS security concepts. The participants had access to a real water treatment facility and they interacted with simulated components and ICS honeypots. S3 includes international teams of attackers and defenders both from academia and industry. It was conducted in two phases. The online phase (a jeopardy-style capture the flag event) served as a training session and presented novel categories not found in traditional information security CTFs. The live phase (an attack-defense CTF) involved teams testing new attack and defense techniques on SWaT: our water treatment testbed. During the competition we acted as judges, and we assigned points to the attacker teams according to a scoring system that we developed internally.

In particular, we investigate the downlink of 802.11 networks in infrastructure mode (e. g. from an access point to a terminal) using Commercial-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) devices. Recent 802.11n/ac amendments introduced several physical and link layer features, such as MIMO, spatial diversity, and frame aggregation, to increase the throughput and the capacity of the channel. Several information theoretical studies state that some of those 802.11n/ac features (e. g. beamforming) should provide a degradation of performance for a passive eavesdropper. However, the real impact of those features has not yet been analyzed in a practical context and experimentally evaluated. We present a theoretical discussion and a statistical analysis (using path loss models) to estimate the effects of such features on a passive eavesdropper in 802.11n/ac, using 802.11b as a baseline. We use Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) and Packet-Error-Rate (PER) as our main metrics. We compute lower and upper bounds for the expected SNR difference between 802.11b and 802.11n/ac using high-level wireless channel characteristics. We show that the PER in 802.11n/ac increases up to 98% (compared to 802.11b) at a distance of 20 meters between the sender and the eavesdropper. To obtain a PER of 0.5 in 802.11n/ac, the attacker‚Äôs maximal distance is reduced by up to 129.5 m compared to 802.11b. We perform an extensive set of experiments, using COTS devices in an indoor office environment, to verify our theoretical estimations. The experimental results validate our predicted effects and show that every amendment add extra resiliency against passive COTS eavesdropping.","tags":null,"title":"Practical Evaluation of Passive COTS Eavesdropping in 802.11b/n/ac WLAN","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I‚Äôm happy to announce that my poster titled Towards high-interaction virtual ICS honeypots-in-a-box won the ST Engineering Poster Award at the FIRST industry workshop, held at SUTD.

Finally, we heard two presentations from two SUTD cybersecurity professors about novel cybersecurity problems and solutions, such as cyber-physical systems, IoT and adversarial machine learning. We understood the importance of education and awareness when talking about cybersecurity.\nAfter lunch we visited SUTD‚Äôs world-class cybersecurity facilites. We started from iTrust, SUTD‚Äôs cybersecurity research centre. iTrust covers a broad range of topics spanning from theoretical to applied cybersecurity. The range of research area covered spans from traditional computer security to domain-specific areas such as: industrial control systems, Internet of Things, and autonomous vehicles.\niTrust in collaboration with the Singapore government and private industries has developed four state-of-the-art testbeds. Those testbed allow researchers to apply and evaluate their ideas in realistic and safe environment. We now briefly comment of each of the testbed. The Secure Water Treatment testbed is the oldest and it includes advanced sub-processes such as Ultrafiltration and Reverse Osmosis. The water treated by SWaT is one of the sources of the second oldest testbed: the Water Distribution (WaDi) testbed. WaDi is a miniaturized reproduction of a water distribution facility with six consumers tanks with independent demands patters. WaDi can be used to simulated water leakages, water-hammer attacks and water contamination. Both SWaT and WaDi can be powered by EPIC the smart grid testbed. EPIC is the newest and less-know testbed at SUTD and several researchers are actively working to evaluate it. Finally, we visited the Internet-of-Things testbed that includes an anechoic chamber to perform radio tests and several Commercial-Off-The-Shelf devices (such as IP camera, smart thermostats and smart lamps) to recreate a smart home environment.\nOverall it was a very rich experience.

Honeypots are vulnerable systems that are set up with the intent to be probed and compromised by attackers. Analysis of those attacks then allows the defender to learn about novel attacks and general strategy of the attacker. Honeypots for ICS systems need to satisfy both traditional ICT requirements, such as cost and maintainability, and more specific ICS requirements, such as time and determinism. We propose the design of a virtual, high-interaction and server-based ICS honeypot to satisfy the requirements, and the deployment of a realistic, cost-effective, and maintainable ICS honeypot. An attacker model is introduced to complete the problem statement and requirements. Based on our design and the MiniCPS framework, we implemented a honeypot mimicking a water treatment testbed. To the best of our knowledge, the presented honeypot implementation is the first academic work targeting Ethernet/IP based ICS honeypots, the first ICS virtual honeypot that is high-interactive without the use of full virtualization technologies (such as a network of virtual machines), and the first ICS honeypot that can be managed with a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller.","tags":null,"title":"Towards high-interaction virtual ICS honeypots-in-a-box","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

While a great amount of research has been conducted on network security of office and home networks, recently the security of CPS and related systems has gained increased attention. Unfortunately, real-world CPS are often not open to security researchers, and as a result very few reference physical-layer processes, control systems and communication topologies are available. In this work, we present MiniCPS, a toolkit intended to alleviate this problem. The goal of MiniCPS is to create an extensible, reproducible research environment for network communications, control systems, and physical-layer interactions in CPS. Instead of focusing on a customized simulation settings for specific subsystems, the main goal is to establish a framework to connect together real CPS soft- and hardware, simulation scripts for such components, and physical-layer simulation engines. MiniCPS builds on Mininet to provide lightweight real-time network emulation, and extends Mininet with tools to simulate typical CPS components such as programmable logic controllers, which use industrial protocols (eg. EtherNet/IP, Modbus/TCP). To capture physical-layer interactions, MiniCPS defines a simple API to connect to physical-layer simulations. We demonstrate applications of MiniCPS in two example scenarios, and show how MiniCPS can be used to develop attacks and defenses that are directly applicable to real systems.","tags":null,"title":"MiniCPS: A toolkit for security research on CPS networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.

These devices require low cost test methodologies and security against cryptanalytic and invasive attacks. In this work we propose an on-chip implementation of a reduced set of NIST-SP-800-22 randomness test suite to provide on-line RNG testing for low cost security devices along with runtime monitoring of RNG performance. The on-chip NIST module monitors the effect of dynamic variation of operating condition and time dependent wear-out on RNG circuits. It indicates invasive attacks on RNG and allows the secure system to take protective measures. Six NIST tests are optimized to a hardware design friendly format, but in compliance with the NIST standard. The lightweight implementations reduce complex statistical and arithmetic operations of conventional NIST tests to a series of bit stream count and compare operations. A cycle-to-cycle serial test of incoming bits from RNG eliminates need for additional storage. A partial re-configurable feature is designed to set the pass/fail threshold for each test depending on the system requirements. The on-chip NIST module, although not exhaustive, is an effective layer of validation and security for RNG circuits. The six 128-bit tests implemented in 45nm NCSU PDK have a total synthesized area of ~1926.sq.um for an optimized frequency of 2GHz. The total dynamic power is 3.75mW and leakage power is 10.5ŒºW. At 2Gbps, the NIST module consumes 1.87pJ/bit.
